VERSE 1:
Am       D
  Just a perfect day,
G               C
  drink Sangria in the park
F                      Dm
  And then later, when it gets dark,
      E
we go home


VERSE 2: [play like verse 1]
Just a perfect day,
feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie, too,
and then home


CHORUS:
   A           D
Oh it's such a perfect day,
C#m                      D
I'm glad I spent it with you
A           E
  Oh such a perfect day,
         F#m     E       D
you just keep me hanging on,
         F#m     E       D
you just keep me hanging on


VERSE 3: [play like verses 1 & 2]
--------
Just a perfect day,
problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own,
it's such fun


VERSE 4: [play like verses 1,2 & 3]
--------
Just a perfect day,
you made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else,
someone good


CHORUS:
-------
   A           D
Oh it's such a perfect day,
C#m                      D
I'm glad I spent it with you
A           E
  Oh such a perfect day,
         F#m     E       D
you just keep me hanging on,
         F#m     E       D    F#m  E  D    F#m  E  D
you just keep me hanging on
